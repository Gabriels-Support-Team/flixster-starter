### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes I felt very well prepared. USing the use effect and use state in the labs was very helpful. I really Enjoyed the lab 2 as well learning the basics of react.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have included the movie poster on the side bar for each watched and liked movie. I would have styled the modal better.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

drilling react use state components was very tedious. In the future I will utilize React stores to avoid this.
